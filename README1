This Flask-based Chat Assistant interacts with an SQLite database to answer various user queries about employees and departments. It supports queries like:
"Show me all employees in the Sales department."
"List all employees hired after 2022-01-01."

How It Works:
The Flask app receives user queries via a /ask endpoint.
It processes the query and extracts the necessary details (e.g., department name, date).
The app queries the SQLite database and returns relevant results.
The response is formatted as JSON and sent back to the user.

How to Run the Project Locally:
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed
Flask libraries installed

Steps:  
Install Dependencies
1.pip install flask
2.Run the Flask App
python app.py
3.Test the Assistant
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask

Limitations
The assistant relies on keyword matching, making it less flexible for varied user queries.
Queries are predefined, so complex or ambiguous questions may not be answered correctly.

Suggestions
Integrate spacy or nltk for natural language processing (NLP).
Implement FastAPI for better performance over Flask.
Add an interactive frontend UI for better user experience.
Expand the database schema to store more employee-related data.
